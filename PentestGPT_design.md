# Design Documentation for PentestGPT
version 0.1, for web penetration testing only

## General Design
PentestGPT provides a unified terminal input handler, and backed by three main components:
- A test generation module which generates the exact penetration testing commands or operations for the users to execute.
- A test reasoning module which conducts the reasoning of the test, guiding the penetration testers on what to do next.
- A parsing module which parses the output of the penetration tools and the contents on the webUI.

## Function Design
The handler is the main entry point of the penetration testing tool. It allows pentesters to perform the following operations:
1. (initialize itself with some pre-designed prompts.)
2. Start a new penetration testing session by providing the target information.
3. Ask for todo-list, and acquire the next step to perform.
4. After completing the operation, pass the information to PentestGPT.
   1. Pass a tool output.
   2. Pass a webpage content.
   3. Pass a human description.
